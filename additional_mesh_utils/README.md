These files generates plenty of meshes in one batch to compare each different parameter of conversion of each library. Python mesh libraries used here are : (TODO)
    - PyMeshLab (Mesh creation): 
    - VTK (Mesh creation):
    - Nii2Mesh (Mesh creation):
    - VoxelFuse (Mesh creation):
    - Trimesh (Mesh creation)
    - Vedo (Plotting):

COMPATIBILITY:
- The main script works well on Python versions 3.8 - 3.11.
- Mesh visualization may not be compatible with Python 3.10 - 3.11.
- Trimesh and Voxelfuse smoothing and simplification functions don't work yet
